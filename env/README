This is the acceptance test suite for hamsterdb. 

Basically, it executes a test script with berkeleydb and hamsterdb, and
frequently checks if both databases are equal.

To get help about options and parameters, run `./test --help'.

To get a quick impression, how it works, run 
`./test ../common/script.tst --verbose=1'.
